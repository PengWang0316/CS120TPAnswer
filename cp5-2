I advise against using single-letter variables names but give a couple of places where they are reasonable.
Can you think of any other legitimate uses for them?

There many cases that a single-letter variable is fine.
Here are some examples
 
In a for loop
example:
for n in a b c d
do
...
done

Using as an index
for (( i=0; i < 10; ++i ))
do
...
done


Read in users input
read n
...
